# Calculator-CLI-App.
This is a basic calculator made using Python. You can type in a full math expression like 12 + 5 * 2 - 3, and it will give you the final answer.

It understands and works with the four common math symbols:

-> + for addition

-> - for subtraction

-> * for multiplication

-> / for division

The calculator follows the correct order of operations, using BODMAS, which means it solves multiplication and division before addition and subtraction. So even if you don't use brackets, it still calculates the right answer based on math rules.
